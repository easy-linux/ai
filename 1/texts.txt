Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Jack who lived in a small village near the forest. 
One day, while walking through the woods, he heard a strange sound coming from the trees. 
He looked up and saw a large black bird perched on a branch. It was a crow!

The crow cawed loudly and flew down to land on Jack's shoulder. 
Jack was amazed and couldn't believe his luck. He had never seen such an amazing creature before!

Jack quickly became friends with the crow and named him Caw. 
The two of them would go on adventures together every day, exploring the forest and discovering 
new things. They would play games, tell stories, and even sing songs together.

One day, while they were out exploring, they came across an old abandoned castle deep in the woods. 
Jack was fascinated by it and wanted to explore inside but Caw warned him not 
to go in as it could be dangerous. 

Jack didn't listen and ventured inside anyway. As soon as he stepped foot in the castle, 
he heard an eerie voice calling out his name from within its walls. 
He quickly ran back outside where Caw was waiting for him with a worried look on his face. 

Jack thanked Caw for looking out for him and promised to never ignore his warnings again. 
From that day forward, Jack always listened to Caw's advice and they continued to have 
many more adventures together!
